# Procfile / Overmind dev-server recipe (auto-detect fallback)

Loaded when `detect-project-type.sh` returns `procfile` and there is no `.claude/launch.json` to consult — i.e. a multi-process dev setup driven by a `Procfile.dev` rather than a single framework dev server.

## Signature

- `Procfile` or `Procfile.dev` exists at the repo root
- No framework signature (`next.config.*`, `vite.config.*`) took precedence at the repo root

## Start command

Prefer `overmind` when available — it handles socket files, supports hot-restart per process, and is the community default for multi-process dev:

```bash
overmind start -f Procfile.dev
```

Fallback to `foreman` when `overmind` is not installed:

```bash
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

If both are missing, prompt the user for the start command rather than guessing.

## Port

Default: `3000`. Procfile-based projects list their processes in `Procfile.dev`, so the authoritative port comes from the `web:` line:

```
web: npm run dev -- --port 3000
worker: npm run worker
```

Parse the `web:` line for `-p <n>` or `--port <n>`. If neither is present, fall through to the cascade in `references/dev-server-detection.md`.

## Stub generation

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Overmind dev",
      "runtimeExecutable": "overmind",
      "runtimeArgs": ["start", "-f", "Procfile.dev"],
      "port": 3000
    }
  ]
}
```

Substitute `foreman` if `overmind` is unavailable on the user's machine — the stub represents what the user will run, not a canonical recipe.

## Common gotchas

- **Socket files:** `overmind` writes a socket to `.overmind.sock` by default. Polish's kill-by-port logic reclaims the port but does not clean up the socket. If overmind is already running and polish restarts it, the new process may fail with "connection refused" until the stale socket is removed. The `OVERMIND_SOCKET` env var can redirect the socket to a per-run path if needed.
- **Procfile vs Procfile.dev:** production and development Procfiles often differ. Always prefer `Procfile.dev` for polish.
- **Multiple web processes:** some Procfiles split web traffic across multiple processes (API + frontend). Polish can only open one URL — users with multi-web setups should author `.claude/launch.json` explicitly to select which process is "the dev server" for polish.
